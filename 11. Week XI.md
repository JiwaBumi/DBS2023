**Normalization**  
Normalization is the process of restructuring your database to become more tidier and reduce redundancy and anomalies. Databases can be evaluated with "forms" and those that went through the process of normalization can be called "normal forms"  
There are many types of normalization, but the most common being 1NF, 2NF, 3NF  
**1NF**  
To meet the requirements of 1NF, the table must:  
- One of the attributes must not hold more than one value (atomicity)
- Has a primary key
- No rows or columns that are duplicates
-
