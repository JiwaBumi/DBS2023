Define the alias, then use it as a way to save time  
Example O from Order table, C from Customer Table, and D from Dishes table   
Then  

SELECT  
O.OrderID,    //PK  
O.CustomerID  //FK  
O.DishID   //FK  
O.OrderTime,  
C.CustomerID,   //PK  
C.CustomerName,  
D.DishID  //PK   
D.DishName  
FROM  
Order O  
JOIN  
Customer C on O.CustomerID = C.CustomerID  
JOIN  
Dishes D on O.DishID = D.DishID  

As you can see [TableName] [Alias] like Customer C defines it. So as long as its defined, you can use C.CustomerID instead of Customer.CustomerID  
Arguably you can use full table name instead of alias if you wish. just replace the alias with full table name on SELECT, and on join just dont mention alias/letters
