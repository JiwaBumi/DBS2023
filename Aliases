Define the alias, then use it as a way to save time  
Example O from Order table, C from Customer Table, and D from Dishes table   
Then  

SELECT  
O.OrderID,    //PK  
O.CustomerID  //FK  
O.DishID   //FK  
O.OrderTime,  
C.CustomerID,   //PK  
C.CustomerName,  
D.DishID  //PK   
D.DishName  
FROM  
Order O  
JOIN  
Customer C on O.CustomerID = C.CustomerID  
JOIN  
Dishes D on O.DishID = D.DishID  

As you can see [TableName] [Alias] like Customer C defines it. So as long as its defined, you can use C.CustomerID instead of Customer.CustomerID  
Arguably you can use full table name instead of alias if you wish
